    "\n",
    "In recent years, the development of science and technology has had many outstanding achievements in general and in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in particular. In the field of imaging, people have been able to take advantage of collecting images from digital electronic devices such as cameras, camcorders, etc. and use them as input for AI models and take advantage of the computing and learning capabilities of AI models to create predictive models serving humans such as traffic control, behavior and emotion recognition, etc. In particular, in the field of transportation, AI has many practical applications serving human interests such as predicting traffic jams, identifying vehicles participating in traffic, recognizing license plates, etc.\n",

The **Pytorch** library is a popular tool specializing in building deep learning models, the library provides us with classes, metrics, optimizers,... to help us build the desired models, more specifically, this library provides us with classes such as **Dataset**, **DataLoader** to help build dataset models to avoid memory overflow problems when saving all images in an array. In addition, supporting libraries such as Numpy, Matplotlib,..."
